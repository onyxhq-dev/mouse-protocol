 * - "core1": the original protocol korkje/mxw reverse-engineered. Full
 *   support — RGB, debounce, battery (glorious-ctl), DPI/polling/LOD (mxw).
 * - "core2": a newer, mostly-undocumented protocol generation (the 4K/8K-class
 *   mice: Model O3 Wireless, Model O2 Pro 4K/8K, Model D2 Pro 4K/8K). Only
 *   RGB, debounce, and battery are enabled for these — glorious-ctl's own
 *   `devices.json` lists Model O3/D2Pro-4K8K alongside the core1 devices and
 *   applies the exact same `mouse.py` commands uniformly, and
 *   AwesomeTy18/GloriousBatteryMonitor independently confirms the exact same
 *   battery-read command (byte-for-byte: class 0x02, subclass 0x02, command
 *   0x83) works across its ENTIRE device list, core1 and core2 alike — two
 *   unrelated implementations agreeing is real evidence RGB/debounce/battery
 *   carry over. DPI, polling rate, and lift-off distance stay OFF for core2:
 *   korkje/mxw's own device list does not include any core2 model, and (for
 *   polling rate specifically) https://github.com/AMarcinkiewicz/GloriousAutoPollingRate
 *   shows the Model D2 Pro 4K/8K's real polling-rate command uses a
 *   DIFFERENT usage page (0xFFFF/0x0000) and report layout entirely from the
 *   one below — confirming core2 is not just core1 with new values, so
 *   guessing at DPI/LOD offsets for it would likely be silently wrong. See
 *   [[glorious-classic-protocol]] in memory for the full writeup, including
 *   the exact D2 Pro 4K/8K polling-rate bytes for whoever wires that in
 *   (needs multi-interface HID support this driver doesn't have yet).
 *
 * KNOWN UNRESOLVED DISCREPANCY: glorious-ctl's devices.json labels PID
 * 0x2011 "Model D Wireless", but two independent, more structured sources
 * (RealCrystalNight's Rust device enum and AwesomeTy18's C# device table)
 * both instead pair 0x2011 with Model O (as its wired-mode PID, alongside
 * receiver 0x2022) and put Model D's wired-mode PID at 0x2012. This table
 * follows the 2-source majority below; if a real Model D Wireless answers
 * "Model O Wireless" in the app, that's why — it's cosmetic only (the actual
 * commands are identical either way), but worth fixing with a hardware
 * report from whoever it happens to.

 * that actually answers (usage 0x01:0x02, opened, featureReports [0]) — the
 * same device's macOS dump did include it, as a separate grant. Without a
 * dedicated filter, this generation falls to RAZER_REGISTRY_FILTERS, which
 * offers the whole device with no usage restriction: every top-level
 * collection appears as an identical, unlabeled checkbox in Chrome's picker,
 * and picking the wrong one(s) silently fails with no way to tell which was
 * correct.
 *
 * Every other Viper-receiver/HyperSpeed-generation model (`viper-receiver` and
 * `new-receiver` transports, `vendorControlInterface` false, not `nativeOnly`)
 * shares this exact interface shape per the driver's own `isMouseControlInterface`
 * contract, so they get the same narrow filter here rather than waiting for
 * each one to be separately reported broken. Left OUT of this batch,
 * deliberately:
 * - `vendorControlInterface: true` models (the pre-HyperSpeed "standard"
 *   generation, and the Viper V3 Pro SE) answer on a vendor-defined page
 *   instead, which is a different filter this evidence says nothing about.
 * - DeathAdder Essential and DeathAdder V2 keep their existing whole-device
 *   filters: their control channel is a split interface, not this shape.
 * - Naga V2 Pro (0x00a7/0x00a8) is already `verified: true` — it demonstrably
 *   connects via the broad filter today, so it is left alone rather than risk
 *   narrowing it to the wrong shape.
 * - Cobra Pro, Naga V2 HyperSpeed, and the Pro Click/Basilisk Mobile
 *   productivity lines were left out: no report or capture confirms this
 *   shape for them, and their extra buttons/wheel make a different interface
 *   layout plausible.
